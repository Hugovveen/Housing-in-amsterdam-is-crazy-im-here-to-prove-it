The baseline linear regression captures the overall structure of housing prices, as shown by the strong alignment along the diagonal. However, predictions systematically underestimate high-priced properties and exhibit increasing variance at higher price levels. This confirms that linear assumptions are insufficient for modeling extreme values and motivates non-linear or transformed approaches.
